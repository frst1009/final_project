<h1>Cooking Monsters</h1>
<p>This site is about finding that inspiration to try different cuisines in the comfort of your own home and bring to the table something new when you find yourself asking what to eat today. Our site won't let you ask that question because you can search for great recipes and find what is popular right now to make. Hope you will enjoy not only learning new recipes but also would like to join the community and create ones of your own. Maybe you have your grandma's old family recipe and would like to bring the light on that creation here you can find that. Be open to judgment because we provide our users the opportunity to leave the comment. Generally, it's a cool place you should check out before you decide what to eat today.</p>
