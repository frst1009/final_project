little documentation about redux:
entire state of the app is stored in the object tree in store
only way to change the state is by actions and then dispatching/sending it to the store
response of state to the action is done by reducers
reducer takes the state and action and returns new state value:
(state, action) => newState
reducer > dispatch > action > state
actions are objects
reducer is function
